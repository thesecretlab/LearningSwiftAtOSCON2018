# Learning Swift with Playgrounds
*Presented by [Paris Buttfield-Addison](https://github.com/parisba), [Tim Nugent](https://github.com/McJones) and [Mars Geldard](https://github.com/TheMartianLife) at OSCON 2018*

Includes two Playgrounds: the **distribution** version, which was pre-made and contains a broader overview of all the content we would have liked to fit in to the talk or extensions thereof, and the **presentation** version, which is an annotated version of that made on stage. [The talk video can also be viewed here](https://youtu.be/Hab3rrpjPAc).

## Topics
On top of a quick into to the Swift language and the benefits of learning and playing with Playgrounds overall, this talk's content covers:
* Types
* Operators
* Flow Control
* Optionals
* Functions
* Structs, Classes and Enums
* Protocols
* I/O
* Debugging

... while discussing the language and environments' strengths, weaknesses and conventions throughout.
