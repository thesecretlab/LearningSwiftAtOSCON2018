 # Learning Swift with Playgrounds
 
 ## The Humans

 G'day! We're Paris, Tim and Mars from Down Under in Australia 🇦🇺 We can be found on Twitter at [**@parisba**](https://twitter.com/parisba), [**@The_McJones**](https://twitter.com/The_McJones) and [**@TheMartianLife**](https://twitter.com/TheMartianLife) respectively.
 
 Please tag us in any livetweeting, we ♥️ that.
 
 ## The Language
 
 Swift is a compiled, statically typed, multiparadigm language designed to be **safe** and **fast**. First released by Apple in 2014, it was built upon the LLVM compiler framework and allows for C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to coexist within a single application. It is also entirely Open Source (yay!).
 
 At its core, Swift is inspired by the C family of languages; it takes a lot of its basics from the well-established syntax of its predecessors. Though quite a few hard requirements have been removed for cleanliness in Swift, there is often nothing stopping you from doing it anyway--such as is the case with statement-ending semicolons.

1 + 1; // for example, this line executes just fine with a semicolon on the end

2 + 2  // but so does this, so why bother?

 ## The Environment
 
 We'll be doing everything in Playgrounds, the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) environment built into Apple's Xcode.  It is similar to Jupyter, in that it is a live-executing environment that allows for quick demonstration and learning with Swift. It also supports Markdown (the beautiful rendering you see here, including links and images right alongside your code). We love them and think tools like this are **the future**. DISCLAIMER: Because it is not yet **the future**, environments like this can sometimes be a little unstable but it's totally worth it.
 
 Swift Playgrounds is also available as an iPad application, which in addition to the features of Xcode's Mac version also supports a book format of multiple Playgrounds pages--and even chapters--toegther in one tidy package, as well as things like hidden and shared code blocks between pages and simpler live view interactions. Much of this will seem more appealing once you get started with Swift and Playgrounds.
 
 This environment has a whole suite of features that can make quick mock-ups a breeze, but most of what we will be using today is just the line-by-line results that can be found in the right sidebar. In many cases, such as where a single line was run multiple times, further details can be found by selecting the rectangular icon beside the result to expand it or see more details.
 
 More advanced guides can be found online that will include use of the live view, a feature we will not be using today, that can be used to make full games within Playgrounds. Along with Playgrounds' full support for use of libraries, there have even been iOS simulators made for it that allow creation of an application almost end-to-end within the environment.
 
 For this demonstration we will be using Swift 4.0 in Xcode v9.4.2, but nothing we're doing is version-specific. Now we only have about 40 minutes so *let's do this*.
